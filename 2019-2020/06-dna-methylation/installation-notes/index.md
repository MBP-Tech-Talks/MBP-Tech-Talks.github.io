### Quick installation using Anaconda

[Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) is a software tool to create software environments for Python and R, and to easily install packages.
You can install most of these tools through `bioconda`.
First install a distribution of [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

Then, create an environment for this workshop by typing in the terminal on of the following, depending on your operating system:

```shell
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Run the downloaded file to install Anaconda.
Then, create an environment for this workshop:

```shell
conda create --name bio1
conda activate bio1
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

Install all the packages by running

```shell
conda install \
    samtools \
    bedtools \
    bwa \
    bwameth \
    metilene \
    fastqc \
    methyldackel \
    fetchChromSizes \
    bedGraphToBigWig \
    deeptools \
    r-xaringan \
    r-diagrammer \
    r-knitr \
    r-kableextra
```
