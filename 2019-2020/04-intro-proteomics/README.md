# Introduction to proteomics

Scripts for performing Label-Free Quantitation (LFQ) or chemical labelling (TMT) are found in `lfq/` and `tmt/`, respectively.
A third example looking at glyco-proteomics can be found in `glyco/`.

The scripts to do these analyses make use of the `source_file.R`, which defines some wrapper and helper functions for each case.

Results from running the script can be found in the `.txt` and `tables.pdf` files in each folder.
