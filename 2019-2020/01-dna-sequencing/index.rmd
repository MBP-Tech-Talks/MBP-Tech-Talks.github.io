## MBP Tech Talks | Fall 2019

Fundamentals of Genome Sequencing and Applications


## Motivations

* Lots of research involves genome sequencing or and analysis
* Few resources covering the fundamentals
* Information is often scattered through blog posts, presentations
* Multidisciplinary - difficult for a single person to discuss thoroughly


## Goals for the fall semester

* Understand foundations of genome sequencing
    * How DNA is captured and read
    * What makes good sequencing data
* Sequence alignment
* Wet and dry sides of sequencing experiments
* How to think about good experiment design when sequencing


## Outline | Part 1: Fundamentals of genome sequencing

* History of reading DNA
* Massively-parallel sequencing
* Standard file formats
* Sequence alignment
* Alignment metrics
    
## Outline | Part 2: Applications of genome sequencing
    
* Mutation detection
* Chromatin accessibililty
* Histone modifications and protein binding
* Transcriptome sequencing
* Chromatin organization
* DNA methylation


## Session structure

* HSB 100, Friday 12:00 - 14:00
* No food or drinks
* Each session has 2 parts, break in the middle


# Fundamentals of DNA sequencing


## DNA molecules

<div class="columns-2">
![](dna-structure.png)


* DNA is double-stranded polymer
* DNA contains 4 nucleotides: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T)
* DNA has a sugar-phosphate backbone
* Nucleotides come in complementary pairs: A-T, C-G

</div>


## DNA molecules

<div class="columns-2">
![](dna-groove.png)

* DNA has a right-handed orientation
* Strands are oriented in opposite directions
* We measure direction by counting 5' to 3'

<!-- [2] Alberts, Molecular biology of the cell, 6ed. pg. 177 -->
</div>

## DNA encodes information for organisms

![](dna-replication.png)


* Complementary strands allow for replication
* Sequences themselves code for proteins inside cells

<!-- [3] Alberts, Molecular biology of the cell, 6ed. pg. 178 -->

## DNA sequencing

* Genome: set of all DNA inside an organism
* Sequencing: the process of measuring the order of these nucleotides in a set of cells


## Early DNA sequencing | Sanger sequencing

<div class="note">
* Just from a high level, since details aren't totally relevant, just the idea
</div>

* Gel electrophoresis
    * Small fragments of DNA are loaded into lanes of gel
    * Small electric potential pulls DNA through gel
    * Larger resistance on longer fragments
* Load polymerase, primers, and ddNTPs to template strand
    * Primers to act as substrate for polymerase
    * Polymerase to bind ddNTPs to template strand
    * Add ddNTPs one at a time to control which nucleotide gets added next

## Early DNA sequencing | Sanger sequencing

![](sanger-seq.png)

<div class="note">
* Separate small portion after adding a particular ddNTP
    * Keep all portions after adding a given ddNTP together
    * Load these in a lane
* Bright band in the lane gives nucleotide
* Vertical position gives order in sequence
</div>

## Early DNA sequencing | Sanger sequencing

<div class="columns-2">
Pros
* Sequence DNA fragments
* Can visually see the order of nucleotides

Cons
* Limited by sharpness of bands
* Limited by length of gel
* X-ray gel exposure, image development, one nucleotide at a time (laborious)
</div>

## Early DNA sequencing | Sequencing by synthesis

* Use ideas of Sanger sequencing:
    * Primers, polymerase, nucleotides
    * Synthesize complementary strand base-by-base
* Instead of measuring all at once via gel, measure fluorescence
